This is a small collection of simple, but efficient data structures in
C.  I'm writing them slowly, whenever I get a chance (usually once in
a while I'll take a night and hack out another one), for a few
reasons: 1) I like to practice my C sometimes, 2) coding data
structures is _far_ better than just reading about them, and 3) I'm
sick of learning other peoples' stupid APIs.

With that in mind, you probably won't want to use these, because
they'll likely have vastly different usage patterns (I change how I
like to do things whimsically and based on BAC), and because there's
no way in hell I'm going to test them completely or maintain them
reliably.
